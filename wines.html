						<h2>Wines</h2>
			<p>The Baskalo's winery and wineyard are located in Sonoma County, CA. The state of California was first introduced to Vitis vinifera vines in the 18th century by the Spanish, who planted vineyards with each mission they established. The wine was used for religious sacraments as well as for daily life. The vine cuttings used came from Mexico and were the descendant of the "common black grape" (as it was known) brought to the New World by Hernán Cortés in 1520. The grape's association with the church caused it to become known as the Mission grape, which was to become the dominant grape variety in California until the 20th century.wines are created to take the guess work out of wine selection to know that you are just going to "Have a Good Time" no matter which wine you choose. We viint both red and wine wines here at HAFGT and each made to show the wine enthusiast that wine can be fun and reasonable.</p>

			<p>I started winery business about ten years ago with my family. It has been a dream for us to build a successful and prestige winery like this one. All of the my family members shared same passion about wines. It took us a few years to build and rise a winery, also couple more to build a name as it is now. Anyway, this wouldn't be possible without our beloved customers. Thanks.</p>
